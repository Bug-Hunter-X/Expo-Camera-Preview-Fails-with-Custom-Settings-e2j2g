# Expo Camera Preview Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera settings.  The camera preview fails to render correctly, displaying a blank screen instead. This problem is particularly prevalent when adjusting settings beyond their defaults, like `autoFocus` or `whiteBalance`.

## Problem Description

The issue is not immediately apparent from console logs, leading to debugging difficulties.  The camera permissions are correctly granted, yet the preview remains blank.  This behavior is inconsistent and might depend on factors such as device, Expo SDK version, and even seemingly minor changes in code unrelated to the camera settings themselves. 

## Solution

A possible solution involves ensuring all camera settings are explicitly set and compatible with each other.  Checking for and handling potential asynchronous operations within the camera setup process might also help resolve this unexpected blank screen issue.
